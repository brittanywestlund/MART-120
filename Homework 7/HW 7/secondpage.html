<h2 style="text-align:center; text-decoration: underline; margin-top: 30px;">The True Story of the '10-Buck Bandit'</h2>
	
<div id="story" style="margin-top: 30px;">
	
	 <p>On the morning of October 10th, 2022, the '10-buck Bandit' struck again; this time, at the small NW MT homeowner's association, Leisure Heights.</p>
	
	<p>Leisure Heights, known to locals as the gateway to underage pot smoking haven, Leisure Park, was a neighborhood intimately known by few: real estate agents, high school upperclassmen, the police, and its own residents. The general public knew little of the middle-class association. Or did they?</p>
	
	<p>In the wee hours of the day, Mr. Westlund, Vice President of the HOA recently turned disaffected association member, noticed something strange. To the right of Mrs. Westlund's Prius C, a car well-suited for the winter roads of NW MT, something had gone missing.</p>
	
	<p>It just so happened that Mr. Westlund was trying to sell an old kayak that had been sitting in his lawn for weeks. This is against the HOA's rules-- and Mr. Westlund knew it. He had served property leins to HOA members for lawn clutter in the past.</p>
	
	<p>The kayak looked ugly in the lawn's crispy, sun-bleached core, and was moved by Mrs. Westlund near the hybrid dispite Mr. Westlund's attempt to gain the neighborhood's interest in the watercraft.</p>
	
	<p>Mr. Westlund never expected what he saw that frigid morning to the starboard side of the kayak. There was a large, round impression in the lawn that was twice as dead as the grass around it. Whatever had been there before was replaced with a ten dollar bill-- coincidently, the Westlund's favorite US tender. "I am not throwing away my shot..." crossed Mr. Westlund's subconscious mind before picking up the dew-drenched bill.</p>
	
	<p>What was taken from the round, shallow grave? Mr. Westlund, absorbed in "other things", can't remember. A groggy Mrs. Westlund, mumbling various HTML tags between sips of coffee, can't remember either. How could two adults in their 30's lose track of something approximately 28 inches in diameter with the mass capable of sinking two inches into the lawn? Their answer, "--No idea."</p>
	
	<p>The '10-buck Bandit,' obsessed with intrigue, petty theft, and 10-dollar bills, has a history of lawn theft and the members of Leisure Heights homeowner's association have gone to extreme measures to avoid another visit by the bandit. Yard gnomes, awkwardly large Donald Trump flags, and broken treadmills alike have been stowed away. Finally, with the removal of the treadmill, the lein on Shannon's house that Mr. Westlund served many years ago could be reduced. In fact, the neighborhood had never looked better aestheticly. </p>
	
	<p>We might never know the identity of the '10-buck Bandit'. Could it be the President of the HOA in an attempt to seek vengence for Mr. Westlund's untimely resignation? What about Mrs. Westlund, given her history of moving things that are out on the lawn? Or was this the work of the upperclassmen in a state of euphoric indifference?</p>
	
	<p>This is the unsolved mystery of the '10-buck Bandit.'</p>
